# Fraud Detection SQL Queries

A collection of SQL queries designed to detect common fraud patterns in financial transactions, account activity, and claims data.

## Overview

This repository contains SQL queries I've developed based on my experience in Medicare compliance and risk assessment. These queries can be adapted for various fraud detection scenarios including:

- Transaction monitoring
- Account takeover detection
- Claims fraud identification
- Duplicate payment detection
- Velocity checks

## Query Categories

### 1. Duplicate Transaction Detection
Identifies potential duplicate transactions that may indicate fraud or system errors.

### 2. Unusual Transaction Patterns
Flags transactions that deviate significantly from normal behavior patterns.

### 3. Account Velocity Checks
Detects accounts with unusually high activity rates that may indicate fraud.

### 4. Cross-Account Pattern Analysis
Identifies suspicious patterns across multiple accounts.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL query optimization
- Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Data aggregation and statistical analysis
- Fraud prevention logic

## Use Cases

These queries are designed for:
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare/insurance companies
- E-commerce platforms
